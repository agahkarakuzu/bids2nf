  note: |
    Input (MRS-MRF related) files (under the `mrs` directory) for this example dataset are:
      - `sub-01_task-baseline_mrsref.nii.gz`
      - `sub-01_task-pain_mrsref.nii.gz`

    On the other hand, the `T1w` file is under the `anat` directory: `sub-01_T1w.nii.gz`.

    By default, **bids2nf** is configured to loop over [`subject`, `session`, `run`, `task`] entities (see [`loop_over`](#global-configuration)). Given that the
    `T1w` file does not have a `task` entity shared with either of these MRS-MRF files, Nextflow
    will emit it as a separate channel by default. 
    
    However, there may be a need to have all these files in
    the same channel. To do so, you can use the `include_cross_modal` option to include the `T1w` file in one 
    of the suffixes (`mrsref`, in this case) to merge `T1w` channel (or some other suffix) onto it, as implemented in this example.
    > Alternatively you can customize `loop_over` to exclude the `task` entity and define `named sets`, assuming that the task values are known beforehand.
