**bids2nf** is a lightweight utility that parses BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) datasets and emits structured Nextflow [channels](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/channel.html). These channels provide a standardized interface for building scalable, modular, and reproducible neuroimaging workflows with [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io).

:::{card}
:header: ðŸª¶ Lightweight
Minimal dependencies with [shell-based BIDS parsing](https://github.com/CoBrALab/libBIDS.sh) for fast, efficient processing.
:::

:::{card}
:header: ðŸ”€ Nextflow native
Built with [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io) DSL2 modularity in mind, enabling neuroimaging researchers to leverage scalable, reproducible workflows.
:::

:::{card}
:header: ðŸ§© Customizable
Though [BIDS-first](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), bids2nf is highly configurable and can be adapted to work with custom dataset structures beyond strict BIDS compliance.

:::{seealso} Reference
Implementation of `bids2nf` adheres to the design principles of modular and portable neuroimaging pipelines as described in [](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10334-025-01245-3)

Built with [nf-neuro](https://scilus.github.io/nf-neuro) in mind.
