# Installation

::::{danger} Prerequisites
:class: dropdown
:label: prereq

## Prerequisites

## üîÄ Install Nextflow
Follow the [Nextflow installation guide](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/stable/install.html).

## üê≥ Pull Docker image for the BIDS Validator (optional)

Download a Nextflow-compatible BIDS Validator image tailored to your system architecture:

* Standard Unix systems (`amd64`)
```
docker pull agahkarakuzu/bids-validator-amd64
```

* Apple silicon (`arm64`)
```
docker pull agahkarakuzu/bids-validator-arm64
```

:::{note}
By default, `bids2nf` validates your BIDS dataset. You can configure it to use a local installation of [`bids-validator`](https://bids-validator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), or disable validation entirely if preferred.

:::{warning} üçé Important warning for macOS users
:icon: false
:class: dropdown

The default bash version on macOS does not meet `libBIDS` requirements. Install a newer bash with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install bash
```

Then set `process.shell` in your `nextflow.config` to:
- Apple Silicon: `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash`
- Intel Macs: `/usr/local/bin/bash`
