# Supported BIDS Data Types

This page documents the BIDS data types supported by bids2nf.

## Named Sets

Named sets define specific collections of files with predefined names and properties.

### MTS

**Required files:** T1w, MTw, PDw

| File | Description | Properties |
|------|-------------|------------|
| T1w | T1-weighted image assuming flip-02 is the larger flip angle | flip: flip-02, mtransfer: mt-off |
| MTw | Magnetization transfer weighted image of the PD pair. | flip: flip-01, mtransfer: mt-on |
| PDw | Proton density weighted image assuming flip-01 is the lower flip angle | flip: flip-01, mtransfer: mt-off |

### TB1TFL

**Required files:** anat, famp

| File | Description | Properties |
|------|-------------|------------|
| anat | Anatomical-like image generated by the tfl_b1_map product sequence | acquisition: acq-anat |
| famp | scaled flip angle map | acquisition: acq-famp |

### RB1COR

**Required files:** bodyMTw, bodyT1w, bodyPDw, headMTw, headT1w, headPDw

| File | Description | Properties |
|------|-------------|------------|
| bodyMTw | MTw B1- field from the body coil | acquisition: acq-bodyMTw |
| bodyT1w | T1w B1- field from the body coil | acquisition: acq-bodyT1w |
| bodyPDw | PDw B1- field from the body coil | acquisition: acq-bodyPDw |
| headMTw | MTw B1- field from the head coil | acquisition: acq-headMTw |
| headT1w | T1w B1- field from the head coil | acquisition: acq-headT1w |
| headPDw | PDw B1- field from the head coil | acquisition: acq-headPDw |

## Sequential Sets

Sequential sets define collections of files organized by BIDS entities.

### VFA

**Organized by entity:** flip

### IRT1

**Organized by entity:** inversion

### TB1DAM

**Organized by entity:** flip

### MEGRE

**Organized by entity:** echo

### MESE

**Organized by entity:** echo

### TB1SRGE

**Organized by entities:** flip, inversion (hierarchical order)

### TB1EPI

**Organized by entities:** echo, flip (hierarchical order)
